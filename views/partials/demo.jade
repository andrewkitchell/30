      div We designed 30 WORDS so travelers could carry it everywhere.  <br><br>
        | You never know when you'll feel inspired
        | to strike up a conversation, so 30 WORDS is passport-sized and ultra-lightweight, so you can carry it
        | easily in any pocket.

      h2 Focused Content
      div At 30 WORDS, we believe you only need a few words to start a conversation.  Honestly, most travelers would
        | be well served even by knowing just 30 words. <br><br>
        | However, 30 WORDS gives you quick access to 900 words and phrases,
        | more than you'll need for almost any adventure.

      h2 Ultra-Durable
      div Why build a durable language guide?  30 WORDS travelers are folks who go for night swims,
        | explore rainy jungles, and engage in conversations lively enough to spill a coffee.<br><br>
        | Therefore, we made 30 WORDS waterproof & tear resistant, so you'll always feel safe slipping
        | your guide into your pocket, swimsuit, or jacket.

      h2 Affordable & Basic
      div Yep.  Word has reached us that smartphones are selling pretty well these days.  However, in developing
        | 30 WORDS, we wanted to build a guide that you'd feel comfortable using
        | in a crowded market, on the beach, or in the rain.  </br></br>

        | Trust us, it is also hard to bargain when you
        | pull out your iPhone and ask for 20% off...
