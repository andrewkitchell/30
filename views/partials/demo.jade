        | You never know when you'll feel inspired
        | to strike up a conversation, so 30 WORDS is passport-sized and ultra-lightweight, so you can slide it
        | easily in any pocket.

      div You only need a few words to delight those you meet.  (Most travelers
        | are well served by speaking ~50 words) <br><br>
        | 30 WORDS language guides give you rapid access to 900 words and phrases,
        | more than you'll need for almost any adventure.

      h2 Ultra-Durable
      div 30 WORDS users are folks who go for night swims,
        | explore rainy jungles, and engage in conversations lively enough to spill a coffee. <br><br>
        | Therefore, we made 30 WORDS waterproof & tear resistant, so you'll always feel safe slipping
        | your guide into your pocket, swimsuit, or jacket.

      h2 Affordable & Practical
      div Word has reached us that smartphones are pretty popular these days.
        | In developing 30 WORDS, we wanted to build a guide that you'd feel comfortable using
        | in a crowded market, on the beach, or in the rain. </br></br>

        | Furthermore, we still believe that connecting with others should not depend
        | on access to a wireless signal or a power outlet.

      h2 100% Recyclable & Upcyclable
      div 30 WORDS are printed on a material that is 100% upcyclable & non-toxic.
       | In fact, we went to press only when we found a material that met these standards, while maintaining exceptional durability. <br><br>
       | Sadly, We could talk paper all day - write us if you have any questions!
